#+TITLE: Mixere

Mixere is an audio mixer for live productions. This repository contains my fork, modernizing it to build with modern versions of Visual Studio on Windows 10 and 11.

* Features
  - One-shot and looping playbacks, with dynamic start and end loop points.
  - Multiple tracks. Indivudal tracks can be played, paused, stopped, muted, looped, or utilize automation independenty.
  - Configurable fade in and out on playback and mute states.
  - Track automation, allow for programming of volume, tempo, and pan settings.
  - Unlimited undo and snapshots. Don't worry about losing state.
  - Works well in WINE.

* Building
** Windows 
  Mixere dates from the late 90s and early 2000s, and thus is not (yet) 64-bit compatible. Howver, the 32-bit debug and release builds can be built by opening the project file (Mixere.vcproj) in Visual Studio 2022.

** Elsewhere
   Building a project using the Microsoft Foundation Class libaries on non-MSVC compilers is certainly an effort. It may be possible to setup an =msbuild= environment within WINE. I'd love to get cross-compiled builds from *nix working.

   If you have success, do open an issue to explain how. Otherwise, for now, you're on your own.
