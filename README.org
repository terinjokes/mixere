#+TITLE: Mixere

Mixere is an audio mixer for live productions. This repository contains my fork, modernizing it to build with modern versions of Visual Studio on Windows 10 and 11.

* Features
- One-shot and looping playbacks, with dynamic start and end loop points.
- Multiple tracks. Indivudal tracks can be played, paused, stopped, muted, looped, or utilize automation independenty.
- Configurable fade in and out on playback and mute states.
- Track automation, allow for programming of volume, tempo, and pan settings.
- Unlimited undo and snapshots. Don't worry about losing state.
- Works well in WINE.

* Building
** Windows
Mixere 32-bit and 64-bit builds can be build by opening the solution (=Mixere.sln=) in Visual Studio 2022. Optionally, the solutions can be build with =msbuild=, see CI builds for an example.

** Elsewhere
Building a project using the Microsoft Foundation Class libaries on non-MSVC compilers is certainly an effort. It may be possible to setup an =msbuild= environment within WINE. I'd love to get cross-compiled builds from *nix working.

If you have success, do open an issue to explain how. Otherwise, for now, you're on your own.
